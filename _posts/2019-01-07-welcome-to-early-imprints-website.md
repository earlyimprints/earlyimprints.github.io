Having had a Wordpress website for the past ten years, I have moved camp to this site.

My intention for this site is to keep you informed of developments in the world of bonding and attachment.  I will also update the site with dates of training and workshop opportunities.

In addition, I will also occasionally make posts here with some of my thoughts and perhaps items I find to be of interest, that I wish to share with you.

Feel free to contact me via my contact details at the [contact me page](../../../contact/) of the web site.  Thanks for paying a visit.
