Along with enhancing uterine contractions for birth it supports the euphoric feeling of love, love making, and fundamental delight.    It’s part of the glue of bonding and helps our relationships stay connected when the going gets tough.  Sometimes the day to day grind takes over and we can lose touch with our heart connection perhaps miss the simple joys of the moment.  Take heart!    Here are some easy, nearly effortless ways to boost oxytocin levels and enhance your loving bonds.

- sharing a meal (Sit across from one another at the dinner table so you can share eye contact.)
- pet an animal friend
- kind touch, a soothing voice

- give Offering a compliment, a kind word, supporting another also increases oxytocin
