I'm pleased to announce that our book, "Welcome to School", written by Charisse and Klaus Kaeppeli, has been released.  It is a simply written book for parents, teachers and anyone involved with children. It describes how a child behaves can be connected with how that child was born and what happened during their time of pregnancy. Importantly, it offers ways that we can support the children who are having difficulty at school.
