                    <p><em>These workshops are experiential.</em> Each participant receives an individual session that varies in length from one to three and one half hours with the entire workshop lasting four days. These sessions are supported by the group as a whole, and this group structure offers the opportunity for exploration beyond what may be possible in one-to-one work. 
					<p>Because our early life is often experienced within the context of family groupings, this workshop setting can mirror some of the original family dynamics, thus giving an opportunity to explore the impact of the early influences on our lives in a safe and therapeutic way. Group sizes are from 4 to 6 people.</p>

                    <p>It is accepted that early relationships shape our brain and nervous system. From gestation and early infancy unseen patterns of relationship are woven into the very fabric of our body and brain. How our brain develops affects our future emotional and physical well-being and influences our expectations and behaviours.</p>

                    <p>In utero and until the age of three, it is the right side of the brain that is predominantly forming. The right hemisphere is considered to be the emotional and the creative area and where much of our pre-verbal memory is stored. The left side is the language area and predominant in logical thinking. During this formative time the matrix of our neural pathways is being laid down, particularly the area related to bonding and attachment. A child conceived and born into a family where there is support and nurturing will develop more pre-frontal synaptic connections, thus creating an increased ability to cope with stress, have healthy anger responses and have an increased potential for relational living.</p>

                    <p>Increased levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, alongside a maternal or family environment which is inadequate or under-resourced will impact on the growth potential of an individual. Because human neurology can continue to develop new pathways throughout the entirety of one’s life, it is possible to “re-programmme” some of these early behavioral patterns. New dendritic formation, i.e., new nerve endings, can occur in response to new experiences enhancing growth and development.</p>
